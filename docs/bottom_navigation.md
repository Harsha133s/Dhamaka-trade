# Bottom Navigation Bar - TradeVerse AI

## Overview
The TradeVerse AI app now features a streamlined bottom navigation bar specifically designed for Android and iOS devices. This navigation provides quick access to the four main sections of the app.

## Navigation Tabs

The bottom navigation contains exactly 4 tabs as requested:

1. **ðŸ•’ Today** - Main dashboard with today's trading summary and AI insights
2. **ðŸ“… Calendar** - Trading calendar with news events and scheduled trades
3. **ðŸ“Š Analytics** - Comprehensive analytics and performance metrics
4. **ðŸ’¬ Community** - Social trading features and community posts

## Design Features

### Visual Design
- **Dark Theme Consistency**: Matches the app's dark theme with `surfaceColor` background
- **Icon States**: Each tab has both outlined and filled icons for inactive/active states
- **Typography**: Clean labels using Inter font family at 11px
- **Elevation**: Subtle shadow effect to separate navigation from content

### Interactive Elements
- **Haptic Feedback**: Light impact feedback on tap for better user experience
- **Smooth Animations**: 200ms transitions for all state changes
- **Active State Indicators**:
  - Icon scaling (1.1x when selected)
  - Color changes to primary blue (#3B82F6)
  - Background highlight with primary color at 10% opacity
  - Subtle glow effect around selected icons

### Responsive Behavior

- **Size**: Fixed height of 72px with proper safe area padding
- **Touch Targets**: Comfortable touch areas with rounded 12px borders

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `lib/core/widgets/app_bottom_nav.dart` - Complete redesign of bottom navigation
2. `lib/app/app_scaffold.dart` - Updated to handle platform detection

### Navigation Logic
- Maps to existing route indices in the app scaffold
- Maintains consistent navigation state across the app
- Proper route handling with Go Router integration

### Platform Restrictions
The navigation only appears on:
- Android devices (`Platform.isAndroid`)
- iOS devices (`Platform.isIOS`)
- Small screen sizes (â‰¤600px width)

Web and desktop users will continue to use the sidebar navigation rail.

## Code Quality
- Passes `flutter analyze` with no errors
- Follows Material Design 3 guidelines
- Implements proper accessibility features
- Uses theme-aware colors and typography

## Usage
The bottom navigation automatically appears when users are on mobile devices and provides seamless navigation between the four main sections of the app. The navigation state is preserved when switching between tabs, and smooth animations enhance the user experience.
